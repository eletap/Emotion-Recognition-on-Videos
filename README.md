# Real Time Emotion Recognition on Videos
*Assignment for Machine Learning on Multimodal Datasets.* 

The goal of this project is to come up with a fast and efficient solution for real-time emotion recognition on videos. It makes use of a pretrained classification model (e.g. see reference below) for the prediction of expressions.
Additionally, pre-trained models from OpenCV and dlib are used, for face and facial landmark detection. 
This repository contains a notebook with an execution example (both for batch data, as well as a single demo). A full report on PDF is also available (in Greek).
